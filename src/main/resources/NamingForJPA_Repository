Start with a keyword
Common prefixes: """""findBy, readBy, getBy, queryBy, countBy, deleteBy, existsBy""""".
Example: findByUsername(String username) → SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?.


Follow with property names
The property must match a field in your entity class.
Example: findByEmail(String email) → looks for the email field in the entity.


Use operators for conditions
Keywords like GreaterThan, LessThan, Between, Like, In, Not, IsNull, StartingWith, EndingWith.
Example:
findByBalanceGreaterThan(double balance) → WHERE balance > ?.
findByAgeBetween(int min, int max) → WHERE age BETWEEN ? AND ?.


Combine with logical connectors
And, Or can chain multiple conditions.
Example: findByFirstNameAndLastName(String first, String last) → WHERE first_name = ? AND last_name = ?.


Support for sorting and limiting
OrderBy + property + direction (Asc, Desc).
Example: findByAgeOrderByLastNameAsc(int age) → WHERE age = ? ORDER BY last_name ASC.
